# Hi there, welcome to My GitHub! 👋


## 🙋 Who Am I?
After several years in various roles, I found my passion in technology, starting with an enriching two-plus years at Apple. At the ripe age of 25, I pivoted to building automation and spent a decade mastering industrial, commercial, and residential electricity. My projects ranged from production line setups to sophisticated home automation systems.

A tech enthusiast since the days of LEGO Technics, I've embraced the digital side of technology with a focus on Arduino and Raspberry Pi projects, which merge my love for engineering with practical applications.

## 🚀 Current Focus
Now moving into the second chapter of my career, I am fully engaged in the design and development of software and applications. This transition is fueled by my commitment to lifelong learning and my fascination with the endless possibilities in the tech world.

## 💻 Technologies
